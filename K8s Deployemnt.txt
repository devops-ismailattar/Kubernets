
############################# CREATE A DEPLOYMENT AND ALSO UPDATE APP VERSION ###############################

First check the deployments

$ kubectl get deployments

now create deployment using manifest 

$ vim deployment.yaml

 name: my-deployment
  labels:
    app: test
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: testing
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: testing
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80

		
Create a deployment now
		
$  kubectl create -f deployment.yaml

check the deployments

$ kubectl get deployments

it will also create rs and pods , check that as well

$ kubectl get rs

$ kubectl get pod

################UPDATING THE APPLICATION VERSION ######################

open the yaml manifest of current deployemnt 

$ vim deployment.yaml

 name: my-deployment
  labels:
    app: test
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: testing
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: testing
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.14.2  ########(change the version here from nginx to nginx:1.14.2 )
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80


now apply deployemnt

$ kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml


then check replicas as there will be 2 replicas

$ kubectl get rs (YOU WILL SEE THAT THE OLDER PODS ARE BEING DELETED FROM OLD RS AND BEWING CREATED IN NEW RS)

now check the events of deployemnt and also current image of container

$ kubectl describe deployment my-deployment (you will see how pods sclaed up and scaled down from each replica)


you can also check the rollout history assocaited with deployemnt

$ kubectl rollout history deployment my-deployment


if you want additional information of any rollout history then run below command

$ kubectl rollout history deployment my-deployment --revision "your number"



########################### ROLLBACK OF DEPLOYMENT ###################

check the rollout history fist

$ kubectl rollout history deployment my-deployment

then choose a revision you want your application rollback to and run below command

$ kubectl rollout undo deployment my-deployment --to-revision=1

check RS status , you will see the defrence

$ kubectl get rs
